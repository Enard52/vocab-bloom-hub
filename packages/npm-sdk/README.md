# @vocab-bloom-hub/client

Typed client for the public read-only API of a [Vocab Bloom Hub](https://github.com/Fristail27/vocab-bloom-hub) instance — an English dictionary with IPA, CEFR levels, sense-level definitions, examples, translations (Russian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic) and inflected forms, served under `/api/v1`.

Documentation, the API reference and a playground: [vocab-bloom-hub.com](https://vocab-bloom-hub.com/en/docs/sdk/node).

- One method per endpoint, typed from the server's OpenAPI document — the types cannot drift from the API.
- Node.js ≥ 20 and browsers; `fetch` only, no dependencies; ESM and CommonJS.
- Errors are thrown as typed exceptions; `AbortSignal` on every call; optional ETag cache for repeated reads; opt-in retry on `429` / `5xx` honouring `Retry-After`; a versioned `User-Agent`.

## Install

```bash
npm install @vocab-bloom-hub/client
```

Stable releases publish under `latest`. A prerelease publishes under its channel dist-tag
(`alpha`, `beta`) and never takes `latest`, so it has to be named:
`npm install @vocab-bloom-hub/client@beta`.

## Quick start

```ts
import { VocabBloomClient, NotFoundError } from '@vocab-bloom-hub/client';

const client = new VocabBloomClient({ baseUrl: 'https://dict.example.com' });

// search: relevance tiers, typo tolerance
const { data, meta } = await client.search({ search: 'definately' });
console.log(meta.fuzzy, data[0].word); // true "definitely"

// a headword with every part of speech, forms, meanings and translations
try {
  const run = await client.word('run');
  console.log(run.data[0].meanings[0].definition);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof NotFoundError) console.log('no such word');
  else throw error;
}

// walk the whole dictionary, page after page
for await (const word of client.iterateWords({ word_level: ['A1', 'A2'], with_meanings: true })) {
  console.log(word.word, word.meanings.length);
}
```

## Runnable cursor pagination example

[`examples/cursor-pagination.mjs`](https://github.com/Fristail27/vocab-bloom-hub/blob/main/packages/npm-sdk/examples/cursor-pagination.mjs)
walks the verbs of an instance with `client.words()`, two entries per page. It prints the
dataset's metadata and terms first, then each page's entries with their origins, contributions
and licenses, and labels entries changed on the instance (see [License](#license)).

With Node.js ≥ 20, save the linked file as `cursor-pagination.mjs` in an empty directory, then run:

```bash
npm install @vocab-bloom-hub/client
node cursor-pagination.mjs https://dict.example.com
```

Replace the URL with your instance's base URL; `/api/v1` is appended by the client.
The example imports the package's public ESM export and needs no other dependency.
From a repository checkout, use the pinned Yarn and build the SDK first (Node.js ≥ 22.13):

```bash
yarn install --immutable
yarn workspace @vocab-bloom-hub/client build
node packages/npm-sdk/examples/cursor-pagination.mjs http://localhost:3010
```

For an isolated local walkthrough, run `yarn workspace server fixture:public-api` in another
terminal (Node.js ≥ 24.9). It uses an in-memory SQLite database and prints `LISTENING <url>`.
Use that URL in the command above: its three verbs produce two pages and `Done: 3 entries
across 2 page(s).` Stop the fixture with Ctrl+C when finished.

The first request omits `cursor`. Every subsequent request keeps `limit` and `part_of_speech`
unchanged and passes `meta.next_cursor` back exactly as received; the cursor is opaque.
An absent cursor ends the walk, even on a full final page. An empty first page prints
`No entries match the filter.` and completes without an extra request. SDK failures go to
stderr and set a non-zero exit code; the example does not retry automatically.

When you only need entries, replace the manual loop with the existing convenience API:

```js
for await (const word of client.iterateWords({ limit: 2, part_of_speech: ['verb'] })) {
  console.log(`${word.word}${word.modified ? ' (changed on this instance)' : ''}`);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(word, null, 2));
}
```

`iterateWords()` fetches pages lazily and follows their cursors for you. Keep the metadata
display and error handling around it. Running both loops reads the same entries twice.

Every method resolves to the `{ data, meta }` envelope the API answers with and takes an optional last argument `{ signal, headers, timeoutMs }`. The request and response types (`Word`, `Meaning`, `SearchRequest`, `ListWordsQuery`, …) are exported — the request types of the `GET` reads are their query strings, so a `SearchRequest` is `{ search, type?, limit? }` — and so are the raw generated `paths` / `components` / `operations` for anything not aliased. The contract itself — tiers, filters, cursor pagination, caching — is documented in the server's [`docs/api.md`](https://github.com/Fristail27/vocab-bloom-hub/blob/main/docs/api.md).

### Options

```ts
new VocabBloomClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://dict.example.com', // origin of the instance; /api/v1 is appended
  headers: { 'X-App': 'my-app' }, // sent with every request
  cache: true, // ETag revalidation (see below); or your own ResponseCache
  fetch: myFetch, // a custom fetch (instrumentation, polyfills, tests)
  timeoutMs: 10_000, // fail a hung request with NetworkError; null disables (the default is 10 s)
  retry: { attempts: 3, backoffMs: 500, maxDelayMs: 60_000 }, // opt-in: retry the GET reads on 429 / 5xx (see below)
});
```

`timeoutMs` can also be passed per call and combines with your `signal` — whichever fires first aborts the request.

Every request carries `User-Agent: vocab-bloom-hub-npm/<version>` (`USER_AGENT`, built from `SDK_VERSION`) so an operator can tell SDK traffic apart in the log; pass your own `User-Agent` in `headers` to replace it. Browsers own the header and ignore the value.

### Retry

Off by default — the client documents exact request counts against the rate limit, so the loop is opt-in. With `retry: {}` (or explicit `attempts` / `backoffMs`) a `GET` answered `429` or `5xx` is sent again: after `Retry-After` when the server sent it, otherwise after `backoffMs`, then twice that, and so on, up to `attempts` tries in total (the first one included; 3 and 500 ms by default); no single wait exceeds `maxDelayMs` (60 s by default), whatever `Retry-After` says. `POST` requests (the batch lookup, a suggestion), `4xx` answers and network errors are never retried; an abort of your `signal` while waiting ends the wait with `NetworkError`.

### Errors

Failed requests throw:

| Class             | When                                            | Fields                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `NotFoundError`   | 404                                             | `status`, `code` (`word_doesnt_found`), `body` |
| `RateLimitError`  | 429 — the public rate limit                     | `retryAfter` (seconds, from `Retry-After`)     |
| `NetworkError`    | no answer: DNS, connection, TLS, abort, timeout | `status: 0`, `code: 'network_error'`, `cause`  |
| `VocabBloomError` | everything else                                 | `status`, `code`, `body`                       |

Without the `retry` option the client never retries on its own: a `RateLimitError` carries `retryAfter` (seconds) and backoff is the caller's decision.

`code` is the machine-readable error of the API (`invalid_cursor`, `too_many_requests`, …), or `http_error` when the answer was not JSON (a proxy page, for instance).

### ETag cache

With `cache: true` every `GET` answer is kept in memory per URL together with its `ETag`; the next read of the same URL sends `If-None-Match` and, on `304 Not Modified`, returns the kept body — the round trip stays, the payload does not. `MemoryCache` holds 500 entries (least recently used out); pass an object with `get(url)` / `set(url, entry)` for a store of your own. Off by default.

## Development

```bash
yarn workspace @vocab-bloom-hub/client generate        # types from apps/server/openapi/public-v1.json
yarn workspace @vocab-bloom-hub/client generate:check  # fail when the generated types are stale (CI)
yarn workspace @vocab-bloom-hub/client build           # dist/ (ESM, CJS, d.ts)
yarn workspace @vocab-bloom-hub/client test            # unit tests + the client against the real server on SQLite
yarn workspace @vocab-bloom-hub/client pack:check      # publint + arethetypeswrong on the packed tarball (CI, release)
```

The package ships ESM and CommonJS with a declaration file for each (`dist/index.d.ts`, `dist/index.d.cts`); the `exports` map hands every consumer the pair its resolution asks for.

`src/generated/openapi.ts` is produced by `openapi-typescript` from the committed public spec and committed itself: a contract change on the server shows up as a diff here, and `test/contract.spec.ts` fails until every native `/api/v1` operation of the spec has a client method. Compatibility adapters have generated types but no wrapper methods: they are intended for third-party clients replacing their base URL.

## License

MIT for the client. The dictionary data comes under the license of the dataset the instance
serves — CC BY 4.0 for the project's own, the license of the source for another, the one its owner
chose for a dataset of the instance's own: read `license`, `attribution` and `license_text` from
`meta()` and show them with the data (`title` names the dataset). An entry the owner of
the instance changed carries `modified: true`, and `client.history(headword)` says what was changed: say next
to such an entry that it was changed. `wordDatasets(headword)` answers from every dataset of the
instance: each group carries the terms of its own dataset, and entries taken from several groups
are bound by each of them.

A word may have several `origins`, `contributions` and `licenses`. Each license's `origin_id`
refers to its source or contribution snapshot: preserve the name, version, links, attribution
and notices, and respect `license_relation` (`all` or `any`). For example, OpenGloss words
marked as derived from WordNet retain both sets of terms. An unchanged fork keeps the original
terms; actual edits add the fork's captured contribution terms. The primary license from
`meta()` does not replace these word-specific licenses. These fields are optional when
reading older v1 servers. See the
[API source fields](https://github.com/Fristail27/vocab-bloom-hub/blob/main/docs/api.md#word-origins-and-license-associations).

What the licenses ask for:
[DATA_LICENSE.md](https://github.com/Fristail27/vocab-bloom-hub/blob/main/DATA_LICENSE.md#using-data-that-was-changed-on-an-instance).
