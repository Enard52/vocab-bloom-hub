# Contributing to Vocab Bloom Hub

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to Vocab Bloom Hub ❤️

We welcome all kinds of contributions, including:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Documentation improvements
- UI/UX enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Refactoring
- Tests and tooling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js >= 22.13** to run it; the Jest suites need 24.9+ (NestJS 12 is ESM-only and Jest's
  `require(ESM)` needs it)
- **Yarn 4** (the repo pins the version via `packageManager`; enable it with `corepack enable`)
- **PostgreSQL** — optional for development: without `DATABASE_URL` the server uses a local
  `dev.sqlite` whose schema follows the entities automatically, so a change to the data model
  needs no migration until it is ready for Postgres ([`docs/migrations.md`](./docs/migrations.md)).
  A production run and the Postgres-only suites need a real one ([`docs/database.md`](./docs/database.md))

### 1. Fork the Repository

Create your own fork of the repository on GitHub.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fristail27/vocab-bloom-hub.git
cd vocab-bloom-hub
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
printf 'NODE_ENV=development\nADMIN_USERNAME=admin\nADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me\nNEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:3010/api\n' > .env
yarn dev
```

- Admin UI: <http://localhost:3000> (the login page is at `/en/login` or `/ru/login`)
- API: <http://localhost:3010>, Swagger UI at <http://localhost:3010/api>
  ([`docs/api-tools.md`](./docs/api-tools.md))
- Website: <http://localhost:3020>

The dictionary is empty until _Import dictionary_ in the admin UI loads it. The production run
of the same checkout (`yarn build && yarn start`, Postgres) is step 3 of the
[README](./README.md#3-run-without-docker).

## Coding agents

Configure only the clients you use, then start the agent in the repository root:

```bash
yarn agents:setup codex          # or cursor, claude, gemini, copilot, kiro, amp, opencode
yarn agents:setup codex cursor   # several clients
```

[`docs/agents.md`](./docs/agents.md) covers setup, MCP, trust, existing local settings, skills and
first-run checks. [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) contains the shared project instructions;
`.agents/` holds the common configuration and skills. Generated client files are ignored by Git.

Database migrations (Postgres only, need `DATABASE_URL`):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... yarn workspace server migration:generate src/db/migrations/MyChange
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... yarn workspace server migration:run      # also migration:revert / migration:show
```

The public API contract and the two SDKs have generators of their own (`openapi:generate`,
`generate`, `generate_models.py`); the chain and when to run it are in
[`docs/api-tools.md`](./docs/api-tools.md#the-openapi-document-the-public-contract-as-a-file).

Server HTTP tests start the app with `await app.listen(0, '127.0.0.1')` and close it in
teardown with `await app.close()`. Keep the server listening throughout the suite: when
Supertest starts it itself, its wildcard bind and IPv4 requests can reach another local
process on macOS ([Supertest #906](https://github.com/forwardemail/supertest/issues/906)).
For upload tests that expect an early authorization rejection, attach a small in-memory
buffer or send no file: a file stream may still be writing when the server answers and
closes the connection, causing `EPIPE` instead of the expected response.

## Project Philosophy

Vocab Bloom Hub aims to be:

- Simple and maintainable
- Beginner-friendly
- Open for collaboration
- Focused on learning and productivity

Please try to keep contributions aligned with these goals.

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names whenever possible.

Examples:

- `feature/add-authentication`
- `fix/mobile-layout`
- `docs/update-readme`

## Commit Messages

Please write clear and meaningful commit messages.

Examples:

- `feat: add spaced repetition algorithm`
- `fix: resolve vocabulary sorting issue`
- `docs: improve installation guide`

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request:

- Ensure the project builds successfully and `yarn check` passes
- Keep PRs focused and minimal
- Avoid unrelated changes in the same PR
- Update documentation if needed

### Licensing of contributions

There is no contributor agreement to sign. By opening a pull request you agree that your
contribution is licensed under the terms of what it changes: code and documentation under the
[MIT license](./LICENSE), dictionary data — an entry edited in the admin UI, a correction sent
through _Report a mistake_ on a word page and applied by the owner, a dataset revision — under
[CC BY 4.0](./DATA_LICENSE.md) for the project's own dictionary. Other datasets retain their
source terms; edits in an own dataset or fork carry its contribution license without replacing
inherited licenses. Include the original source, version, links and required notices when
transferring data. Keep the model label (`generated_by_model`) truthful on data
you generate: every record names the model behind it, see [`docs/data.md`](./docs/data.md).

### Documentation languages

English is the source language of the documentation. A page may have translated versions next
to it, named `<name>.<lang>.md` (`docs/api.md` ↔ `docs/api.ru.md`; the README's live under
`docs/`: `README.md` ↔ `docs/README.ru.md`, `README.es.md`, `README.fr.md`, `README.pt.md`,
`README.de.md`, `README.zh.md`, `README.ar.md`) and registered under `translations` in
`apps/site/src/content/registry.ts`, where the website renders them under `/ru`, `/es`, `/fr`,
`/pt`, `/de`, `/zh`, `/ar`. The README exists in
every interface language of the apps; the other pages have a Russian version at most. A page
without a translation shows the English text on the site with a notice. Code comments, issue
and PR templates and the pages without a translation are English only.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any change to a page with translations must be applied to every one of them in the same PR so
> they stay in sync section by section.

### Reviewing a translation

The translated texts — the READMEs under `docs/`, the translated pages, the interface messages
of both apps (`apps/site/messages/*.ts`, `apps/frontend/messages/*.ts`) — are machine-made until
a native speaker has read them. A review is a pull request: the fixes, if any, plus one line at
the top of the file with the language, your login, the date and the commit of `main` you read —
`<!-- reviewed: de · @login · 2026-10-03 · 32148f5 -->` in Markdown (after the title),
`// reviewed: de · @login · 2026-10-03 · 32148f5` first in a `.ts` file. Keep the lines of earlier
reviews above yours. A review with nothing to fix is that one line, and it is welcome.

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Code builds successfully
- [ ] Changes were tested
- [ ] Documentation updated if necessary
- [ ] A translation you read as a native speaker carries its `reviewed:` line ([above](#reviewing-a-translation))
- [ ] No unnecessary files included

The `check-pull-request` workflow runs the linters, the typecheck of every workspace, the
unit and e2e suites (SQLite and Postgres), the browser suites, the production and Docker
smokes, and two quality gates: the server unit coverage must not drop below the thresholds
in `apps/server/jest.config.ts` (`yarn workspace server test:cov` reproduces the check), and
`yarn npm audit --all --recursive --severity high` plus `pip-audit` on the Python SDK must
find nothing — fix an advisory by upgrading (`yarn up -R <package>`), not by silencing it.

## Coding Guidelines

Please follow the existing project structure and coding style.

General recommendations:

- Write readable and maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer reusable components
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Keep functions and components small when possible

### Dependencies

- Declare a dependency in the workspace that imports it (`apps/frontend`, `apps/server`, …),
  not at the root; the root holds only the tooling shared by every workspace.
- Peer dependencies must be met. `yarn peers:check` (part of `yarn check`, run in CI) fails
  on any unmet one — Yarn itself only warns. When a package declares a range that lags
  behind the version the monorepo runs and CI exercises the combination anyway, list it in
  `KNOWN_MISMATCHES` in `scripts/check-peer-requirements.mjs` with the reason; the check
  also fails when a listed mismatch is gone, so the list stays current. Yarn's
  `packageExtensions` cannot widen a range a package already declares, which is why the
  exceptions live there.
- Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) watches every workspace manifest, the Python SDK (uv)
  and the GitHub Actions, grouped per directory into one weekly PR each. A new workspace
  must be added to its `directories` list.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to follow the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Releasing

One version covers the whole monorepo; the dataset keeps its own (`manifest.version`). The
repeatable part of a release:

1. **The release PR.** Bump the version everywhere with the only tool allowed to touch it —
   `node scripts/bump-version.mjs <version>` (six files; a CI test keeps them equal) — and
   curate the new `CHANGELOG.md` entry (the `release-changelog` agent skill in
   `.agents/skills/` — `/release-changelog <version>` in Codex, Cursor or Copilot, "run the
   release-changelog skill" in Claude Code — assembles the draft from everything merged since
   the previous tag); the section is dated with the day the tag will be pushed. The same PR
   moves `VBH_TAG` to the new version in `.env.example`, `docs/deployment/docker.md` and the
   install sections of the READMEs — the images exist minutes after the merge, once the tag
   is pushed.
   Merge on green CI.
2. **The tag — the whole release.** On the merged `main`:
   `git tag -a v<version> -m "..." && git push origin v<version>`.
   The one push does everything: publishes the three Docker images with that version
   (`docker.yml`; a prerelease tag never gets `latest`) and runs
   `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which verifies the tag matches the version, publishes
   `@vocab-bloom-hub/client` to npm and `vocab-bloom-hub` to PyPI via OIDC trusted
   publishing — no tokens — and creates the GitHub Release with generated notes
   (categories in `.github/release.yml`; a hyphen in the tag marks it a prerelease).
   A prerelease publishes to npm under its channel dist-tag (`alpha`, `beta`, …), never
   `latest` — npm refuses a bare `npm publish` of a prerelease version.
   An SDK is published only when its package or the public OpenAPI spec changed since the
   previous tag (the version bump alone does not count): a release that touched neither
   leaves the registries at the version they have, so the SDK versions may lag the app's.
   A publish job that failed on the tag push is repeated from the Actions tab: _release_ →
   _Run workflow_ with the tag (the npm and PyPI checkboxes pick the jobs); a plain re-run
   would use the workflow file as it was at that tag.
   The **first npm publish is manual** (`npm publish --tag <channel>` from `packages/npm-sdk`; npm attaches a
   trusted publisher only to an existing package — configure it right after, workflow
   `release.yml`, environment `npm`, then re-run the failed npm job). PyPI's pending
   publisher covers the first publish.
3. **After the tag**: export the dictionary (the manifest carries the next dataset version),
   upload the revision to HuggingFace and git-tag it there with that version.

> [!NOTE]
> PyPI normalizes pre-release suffixes per PEP 440 (`0.1.0-alpha.1` is served as `0.1.0a1`) —
> cosmetic only, the sources keep the semver spelling. Re-run `uv lock` in `packages/python-sdk`
> after a bump so `uv.lock` follows.

> [!CAUTION]
> The tag push is the point of no return: the npm/PyPI publishes cannot be undone — a bad release
> ships a fixed next version instead. Everything before the push is free to redo.

- Semantic search and a semantic network on top of the dictionary (next major version)
- Word relations graph beyond synonyms and antonyms: hypernyms / hyponyms, collocations
- More source languages besides English, and more translation languages beyond Russian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Chinese and Arabic
- Published linguistic datasets built from the dictionary
